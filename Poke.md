# 'Poke' for Novation Launchpad Pro

Poke is simple game firmware for the Launchpad Pro.

Poke is a game for two players, Blue and Green. When turned on,
the Launchpad will pause a few seconds to get ready, then will
start flashing blue and green pads. Each player should try to 
poke their color before it goes off. 

Every time a player 
pokes their color, they get a point. The round is over when a 
player gets 8 points. Current score is shown by the blue or
green buttons on either side. 

When a player gets to 8 points, the whole board will light up
in their color. There will be a pause of a few seconds,
and then a new round starts. Each round is faster -- the
pads will be lit for a shorter time.
